### Introduction
Rumil is a general-purpose programming language in early development. It is designed to give developers a keyword-free, symbol-driven, and linguistically neutral programming experience while also serving as a transcompilation target for high level "dialects" that implement features inspired by natural languages.

Rumil is named after Rúmil, the Elvish loremaster in Tolkien's legendarium that devised the first writing system. In the same way that Tolkien's Rúmil brought written language to the Elves, this project aims to bridge the gap between computer programming and the many human languages that exist.

Rumil aims to accomplish its goals in two ways:
* By providing a keyword-free yet familiar syntax, and
* By being explicitly designed as a transcompilation target for higher level languages that may be inspired by any human language

### Design
- **Paradigm**: Rumil is designed as a general-purpose, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural and functional programming.
- **Inspirations**: Rumil's inspirations include Rust, JavaScript, APL, and Go.

### Learn Rumil
