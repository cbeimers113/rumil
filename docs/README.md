# Rumil Documentation

This directory and its subdirectories contain documentation for all of Rumil's features. As the language develops, implemented features will be documented in their own subdirectories.

The [planned](/docs/planned/) directory contains tentative descriptions of features that are not yet implemented, but are slated for development. The content of those pages are highly susceptible to change as development progresses.
