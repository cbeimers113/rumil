# Conventions

### Naming Conventions
Capitalization is a requirement for the first letter of entity type names and constant field names, while lowercase is required for everything else. The following casings are recommended to go along with these requirements:
* Entity type names: **PascalCase**
* Constant field names: **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE**
* Variable field names, function names, and file names: **snake_case**
